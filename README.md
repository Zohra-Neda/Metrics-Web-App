<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [CryptoCurrency App] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[CryptoCurrency App]** This is a React application that displays information about various cryptocurrencies using data from the CoinStats API (https://api.coinstats.app/public/v1/coins). The app allows users to search for specific cryptocurrencies, view detailed information about each currency, and filter currencies by price, market cap, and other metrics.

The app uses Redux to manage state and includes several reusable components, such as a search bar and a filter component. The app also includes a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

This app was built as a personal project to learn more about React and Redux, and to explore the world of cryptocurrencies. Feel free to use the code as a starting point for your own projects or to contribute to the project if you'd like!
